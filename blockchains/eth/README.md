# ETH Transfer Event Exporter

A small service that exports all ETH Transfers from the ethereum blockchain to a Kafka topic. It is written in javascript and uses ![web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) library which implements the Ethereum JSON RPC spec.

The script is using the transaction traces generated by the parity tracing module. In order to filter out
the failed transfers, we are grouping the traces by transaction hash and check if all the traces in are
successful. If there is a single trace with an error field, we consider the transaction failed and all
the transfer traces to be failed.

## Running the service

To test that the exporter is running correctly use:

```bash
$ ./bin/run_eth.sh
```

## Running the tests

The 'eth' tests are discovered by Mocha test framework. To run all tests run:

```bash
$ ./bin/test.sh
```
